Simple Chat program:
This is a simple program that you can use to chat over the internet. It can hold as many clients as you woule like. 

To run: in ChatClient.java you need to change the 000.00.00.000 ip address to the ipaddress of the computer that the server is being run on.
Then you need to compile and run the server first, and then the clients.
Let me know of any problems.
Thanks
